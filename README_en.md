# About
---
Upon diving into the vast ocean of knowledge that is Network security, the author realized that many topics and concepts often are scattered and unorganized. Learning becomes unnecessarily difficult without a well layed out structure or guide. Thus after grasping the basics, attempted to gather concepts, record them and eventually lead to the creation of this note compilation. The hope is that it can assist those who are planning to learn network security.

Before starting, the question of "what is network security?" needs to be answered. Frankly speaking, network security consists of a series of content, including topics such as websites, web applications, web services and numerous more. In other words, network security focuses on the security of applications and the interactive level. The necessary knowledges of network security includes network protocols, properties of networking applications, their security risks and the usage of various applications. These catagories can be complicated, therefore try the following logic to disassemble and reorganize relevant contents for ease of understanding.

To better understand why the field of Web security is the way it is now, and what direction each study is headed, it is necessary to understand the history of the development and evolution of Web application and network attack and defense technologies. This is also the first part of the notes, focusing around the development and evolution of Web technologies, and the basics of the security field.

The second part of this compliation introduces some of the basics of computer networks. Considering that there are many branches of network databases, web servers, and the rapidly evolution of the field, only network protocols will be covered. The skipped part regarding network applications should be understood with the accompany of various programming languages, web application frameworks, network services and operating system features.

With some foundation, the focus shifts to some more detailed content on attack and defense, such as the study of vulnerability types, programming languages, characteristics of applications and their corresponding security issues. This is the third part of notes. A brief description is provided on information gathering, commonly seen Web vulnerabitlites, languages and frameworks and techiniques on penetration testing. Meanwhile there is also an importance in cloud technology as it becomes an important part of the web world. Whether it is using public cloud to build light services, private cloud. Technologies such as containers are becoming more and more important 

The fourth part returns to the defensive perspective, describing the construction of a security team, threat intelligence and risk control perspectives, as well as some description of more detailed technical content such as honeypots and traceability.

The last portion focuses on the introduction and usage of applications. Included is a list of recommendation for applications and resources, and some contents that are currently unclassified.

The above is the overall summerization of the content, but order is not mandatory. The topic can be from anywhere and start from anywhere of interest. This complilation can be used both as a whole and as a handbook.

As the author is also learning and is human, it is inevitable for errors or incompletes in the process of organizing notes. Errors will fixed and information added in a timely fashion. If there exists any mistakes, readers are welcomed to criticize and correct them through [Issue](https://github.com/LyleMi/Learn-Web-Hacking/issues/new) or [PR](https://github.com/LyleMi/Learn-Web-Hacking/pulls). Help is much appreciated.

A lot of sources were used as reference in the making of these notes, all of which are left with the corresponding links at the end of the article.
